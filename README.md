# Coherence-Meter
A novel, hybrid AIT-MDL framework for detecting systemic regime shifts (structural breaks) in complex, non-stationary systems. This repository contains the computational narrative and all code to reproduce the findings of our paper on using predictive error as a direct measure of local rule incoherence.
